,anyone familiar with vesting?,,,,
,,was trapped for 3-years,,,
,,,incorporated by 6 founders - half non-execs,,
,,,,top level businessmen: ex-GS Real Estate,
,,,,was Senior Partner at Private Equity firm with £6bn funds,
,,,,CEO of company with £350bn+ AUM,
,,,,fluent in 4 languages. remarkable people,
,,,rest of us from normal world ,,
,,,,whilst non-execs from commercial top echelon,
,,,,"execs were tech specialists: CTO, CPO & CSO",
,,,,"was principal software dev AWS, DT expert/PhD",
,,,,founders had made capital contributions '21,
,,,shareholders agreement summer '22 ,,
,,,,1st external round. non-execs fully vested day one,
,,,,"my shares 2% 1 yr, 6% 2 yrs, 14% 3yrs",
,,,,incentivises employees to stay - it works,
,,,,counting down days to summer '25,
,,,turned out to be false summit,,
,,,,actually closer to 3.5 years (could've been longer),
,,,,like lots founders opted to delay salary re cashflow,
,,,,after CPO left was stuck doing just ops/admin ,
,,,,CSO in name only no backing/budget R&D/innovate,
,,how to best serve re:sustain?,,,
,,,believed I had to become independent,,
,,,,re:sustain needed key tools to enhance scalibility,
,,,,couldn't compete but academic institution ok,
,,,,PhD route - harder to refuse me going off to up-skill,
,,,,still had claim to unpaid salary as leverage,
,,,challenges re leaving,,
,,,,"restrictive covenants, IP clauses etc",
,,,,must keep reputation intact/keep all equity,
,,,,always watched by non-execs in board meetings,
,,,,can't be seen as troublemaker,
,,,was bit of a David & Goliath(s) situation,,
,,,,thought what would military strategist do?,
,,,,Heard of Sun Tzu/Art of War? win without fighting etc?,
,,,,morale/moral law - harmony/virtuous conduct,
,,,,chose to use appear weak when strong approach,
,,my particular strategy,,,
,,,PE bigshot was defacto boss > my opponent,,
,,,,had a strict command & control style,
,,,,don't want to be generating high value IP for free,
,,,,needed distraction to escape his grasp,
,,,,I feigned being eccentric academic in a muddle,
,,,IP ownership was main issue,,
,,,,tried 6 unis - negotiations most progressed at KCL,
,,,,unis usually own all IP - KCL £30kpa to have 100%,
,,,,apparently 1/1-4k PhD researchers fully own IP,
,,,,but PE guy wanted to own IP for free,
,,,needed to create illusion that his idea,,
,,,,made feint/ruse to board - Aug '25,
,,,,offered director's loan secured on IP,
,,,,PE guy: too complex for investor optics,
,,the 1st outcome,,,
,,,was told had to do as independent consultant,,
,,,,won 1st battle without them knowing,
,,,,secured board resolution for switch to consultant,
,,,,KCL rules > PE guy's idea to set up R&D Ltd,
,,,,but lots of resistance/surprise re costs forced £0 salary,
,,,had to make 2nd proposal he couldn't accept,,
,,,,PE guy still trying to own IP via consultancy agreement,
,,,,"setup costs, overheads, arrears equity bullet point",
,,,,unreasonable offer trap - share options,
,,,,,"have, say, 2.5 years to buy/exercise"
,,,,,"and say ""£100k"" given at £10m valuation"
,,,,,if doubles I get £100k face value but pre-tax
,,,,,needed triple for after tax face value & buyer too
,,then I was on the final straight,,,
,,,the transition phase,,
,,,,gave employment contract notice under radar,
,,,,incorporated legally separate entity - BirdLab Ltd,
,,,,VAT registration bought time to wind down notice,
,,,,made proposal once had complete freedom to operate,
,,,achieved stalemate in Nov '25 according to plan,,
,,,,an actual offer wouldn't have looked reasonable,
,,,,never corner opponent - golden bridge to step aside,
,,,,never even signed their consultancy agreement,
,,,,finally joined the non-execs,
,,,Steve Jobs NeXT analogy,,
,,,,leaving to build the OS (BirdLab),
,,,,returning when value is proven,
,,,,value realisation (3x multiplier),
